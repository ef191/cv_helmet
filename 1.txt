The system provides precise 6-DOF tracking data utilizing a fusion of inertial-optical technology. Ideal for augmented & virtual reality applications, simulation & training, robotic navigation and more.

The IS-1200+ HObIT low-power, small-sized package can be head-worn with minimal impact or integrated into any object for virtually unlimited tracking. The power and interface for the IS-1200+ HObIT comes from a USB port for flexibility and ease of integration into your tracking application.

The IS-1200+ HObIT is delivered fully factory calibrated and simple-to-use. Fiducial constellation can be installed and mapped to ~50 microns accuracy in just a few minutes using new VisualMapper software provided with the IS-1200+ HObIT. Once installed, the sensor is always ready without need for additional calibration. For use on vehicles, an auto-harmonization algorithm allows the system to self-align the fiducial constellation with the vehicle INS or attitude reference. We have the ability to work with you to meet your custom hardware and software needs.
